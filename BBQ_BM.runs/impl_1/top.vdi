CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1055] Clock 'sys_clk' completely overrides clock 'sys_clk_p', which is referenced by one or more other constraints. Any constraints that refer to the overridden clock will be ignored.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clk [get_ports sys_clk_p], [/home/gabber/FUDAN/workspace/BBQ_BM/BBQ_BM/BBQ_BM.srcs/constrs_1/new/top_constrs.xdc:8]

Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.
